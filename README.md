Creating a website that allows students to attempt quizzes and coding challenges with the goal of increasing student confidence and engagement with 
learning.

The app or website should contain at least two challenges/games. The first should present the user 
with a coding problem and allow the user to input their solution. The second should present the user 
with a cybersecurity scenario or question and allow the user to input their answer.
Once the user has submitted their answers, they should be informed whether their answer was 
current or not, and how many students got the answer. Correct inputs should result in the user 
earning points and possibly badges. As a stretch goal, a top ten leader could be revealed to users at 
the end of the week.

To ensure the life span of the app/website the daily challenges should be stored in the app/website 
with two new challenges being revealed to the users at the start of the day. Admins should be able 
to add as many new daily challenges as they wish at any time.

To determine if interactions with the app positively impact students, there is a data collection side to 
this project. Users should be able to register to the app with their username, student number, and 
password, and all challenges should be tagged by the admins who submit them so that the difficulty 
of the challenges can be tracked. Various other data may be captured to adequately track the user’s
skill improvements over time.
